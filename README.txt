1. This repository comprises of 6 python files, each corresponding to Problem1_a, Probelm1_b, Problem1_c,
Problem2_a, Problem2_b and lastly Problem2_c. These python files has the solution code for each corresponding 
Problem. 

2. Additionally, this folder also consists of the input_INTEL_g20.g2o and parking-garage.g2o data, necessary for 
execution.

3. Ideally, no addition dependicies should be required to run these files. The grader is humbly requested to intall 
any, if prompted.

4. Problem1_a.py and Problem2_a.py loads the .g2o files and convert them into compatible format.

5. These files are imported in Problem1_b, Problem1_c and Problem2_b,Problem2_c to load the data in usable format.

6. The latter optimizes the generated factor graph and also return corresponding trajectory graph on execution.

7. The author adheres to the Honour Code and have commented all the steps in the code for the reader's understanding 
of algorithm and the code.

Thank-you.
